= Apache Camel JBang Examples

dummy change to test behavior on CI

http://camel.apache.org/[Apache Camel] is a powerful open source integration framework based on known
Enterprise Integration Patterns with powerful bean integration.

== Introduction

This project provides examples for low-code integrations with Apache Camel JBang.

=== Examples

This git repository hosts a set of ready-to-use examples you can try to learn more about Apache Camel,
and how Camel can be used to integrate systems. These examples are accessible for non developers, as
they can run without having to use traditional Java compilation or build systems such as Maven or Gradle.

All examples can run local on your computer from a CLI terminal by executing a few commands.

These examples uses JBang as the CLI which is a great tool that makes using Java much easier.

== Install Camel JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,shell]
----
jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can install Camel on JBang via:

[source,shell]
----
jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run Camel with `camel` as shown below.

[source,shell]
----
camel --version
----

== Integration testing

The examples provide automated integration tests that you can run with the https://citrusframework.org/[Citrus] test framework.

You need to install Citrus as a JBang app, too:

[source,shell]
----
jbang app install citrus@citrusframework/citrus
----

Now you can start running commands for the Citrus JBang app with `citrus`:

[source,shell]
----
citrus --version
----

Usually the Citrus tests are written in YAML files and named accordingly to the Camel JBang route source file.

For instance the Camel route `mqtt.camel.yaml` route provides a test named `mqtt.camel.it.yaml`.
You can run the test with Citrus JBang like this:

[source,shell]
----
cd test
citrus run mqtt.camel.it.yaml
----

Usually the test prepares the complete infrastructure (e.g. via Docker compose) and starts the Camel route automatically via JBang.
Of course the test also performs some validation steps to make sure that the Camel route works as expected.
