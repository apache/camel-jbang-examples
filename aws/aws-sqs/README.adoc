= AWS SQS sink

In this sample you'll use the AWS SQS Sink Kamelet.
The Camel integration exposes a Http service and for each incoming request the message body data is pushed to an AWS SQS queue.

== Install Camel JBang

include::../../install.adoc[see installation]

== Setup the AWS SQS Queue

=== Setting up AWS SQS using Camel Infra

AWS SQS can be easily configured and run using Camel Infra.
To start an AWS SQS instance, run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
camel infra run aws sqs
----

Add or replace the following information to the `application.properties` file: 

[source,properties]
----
aws.secretKey=secretKey
aws.accessKey=accessKey
aws.region=us-east-1
aws.overrideEndpoint=true
aws.uriEndpointOverride=http://localhost:4566
autoCreateQueue=true
----

Note: These configuration values can be retrieved from the JSON output generated by the `camel infra run aws sqs` command.

=== Setup AWS SQS using AWS services

You'll need a fully working AWS CLI locally.

Create an SQS Queue where message data is pushed to

[source,shell]
----
aws sqs create-queue --queue-name sqs-news --region eu-west-1
----

Don't forget to specify the correct sqs queue name in the `application.properties` file and adding correct credentials for AWS.

== How to run

Then you can run this example using:

[source,shell]
----
$ camel run application.properties http-to-aws-sqs.camel.yaml
----

Or run it even shorter:

[source,shell]
----
$ camel run *
----

== Developer Web Console

You can enable the developer console via `--console` flag as show:

[source,shell]
----
$ camel run application.properties http-to-aws-sqs.camel.yaml --console
----

Then you can browse: http://localhost:8080/q/dev to introspect the running Camel application.

== Create requests and push data to SQS

While the integration is running you can run the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d 'Camel rocks!' http://localhost:8080/news
----

You will see the message content being processed and the AWS SQS queue should receive a new message with the respective content.

== Integration testing

The example provides an automated integration test (`http-to-aws-sqs.camel.it.yaml`) that you can run with the https://citrusframework.org/[Citrus] test framework.
Please make sure to install Citrus as a JBang application (see link:../../install-citrus.adoc[Citrus installation guide]).

Navigate to the test folder.

[source,shell]
----
cd test/
----

You can run the test with:

[source,shell]
----
citrus run http-to-aws-sqs.camel.it.yaml
----

The test prepares the complete infrastructure and starts the Camel route automatically via JBang.
The Citrus test starts a Localstack Testcontainers instance to simulate the AWS SQS services.
Once the AWS services are configured the test loads the Camel route and creates a proper Http POST request.
As a result you will see the SQS data being consumed by the test to verify the event processing.
