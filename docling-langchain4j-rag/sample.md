## Introduction to Apache Camel

Apache Camel is an open-source integration framework based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs). It provides a rule-based routing and mediation engine that allows developers to define routing and mediation rules in various domain-specific languages.

## Key Features

### 1. Routing and Mediation Engine

Camel supports routing and mediation rules in various DSLs including:

- Java DSL
- XML Configuration
- YAML DSL
- Groovy DSL

### 2. Extensive Component Library

Camel provides over 300 components for integrating with:

- Messaging systems (JMS, Kafka, AMQP)
- Databases (JDBC, MongoDB, Cassandra)
- Cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
- APIs (REST, SOAP, GraphQL)

### 3. Enterprise Integration Patterns

Camel implements all EIPs from the famous book by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf:

- Content-Based Router
- Message Filter
- Splitter and Aggregator
- Dead Letter Channel
- Wire Tap

## AI Integration

Camel now includes AI components for modern integration needs:

### LangChain4j Components

- **langchain4j-chat**: Integrate with Large Language Models
- **langchain4j-embeddings**: Generate vector embeddings
- **langchain4j-tools**: Create AI tools and agents

### Docling Component

The Docling component enables document processing:

- Convert PDF, Word, PowerPoint to Markdown
- Extract structured data from documents
- Support for OCR and table extraction
- Integration with AI models for document analysis

## Use Cases

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**: Convert documents and analyze with AI
2. **RAG Systems**: Retrieval Augmented Generation with vector stores
3. **Intelligent Routing**: Use LLMs to make routing decisions
4. **Data Extraction**: Extract and transform unstructured data

## Conclusion

Apache Camel continues to evolve, now bridging traditional integration patterns with modern AI capabilities, making it an ideal choice for building intelligent integration solutions.
