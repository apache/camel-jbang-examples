First install JBang according to the https://www.jbang.dev/download/[JBang installation guide]

For a more convenient way to use the Citrus JBang scripts you can install Citrus as a JBang app.

.Install Citrus app
[source,shell]
----
jbang trust add https://github.com/citrusframework/citrus/
jbang app install citrus@citrusframework/citrus
----

Now you can run Citrus with `citrus` to execute some tests:

.Run my.camel.it.yaml
[source,shell]
----
citrus run my.camel.it.yaml
----
