First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,shell]
----
jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can install Camel on JBang via:

[source,shell]
----
jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run Camel with `camel` as shown below.

[source,shell]
----
camel --version
----
