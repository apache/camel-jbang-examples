= Open API client

This example uses the Open API specification as a base for a Camel REST client.
The Camel route reads files from a local directory and sends the content in the form of an Open API REST request to a service.

== Install Camel JBang

include::../../install.adoc[see installation]

== How to run

First of all we need a Http REST service that is able to handle the client requests.
You may use the Open API server example in link:../server/README.adoc[../server].

Just navigate to the server directory in a separate terminal window and start the Camel Open API server example with:

[source,shell]
----
camel run *
----

You should see the Camel integration starting and listening on `http://localhost:8080` for incoming requests.
Then you can run the Camel REST client integration using:

[source,shell]
----
camel run petstore-api.json application.properties petstore-client.camel.yaml
----

You may also run this even more concise with:

[source,shell]
----
camel run *
----

Now you should see the client invoking the REST service using the OpenAPI specification rules.

== Integration testing

The example provides an automated integration test (`petstore-client.camel.it.yaml`) that you can run with the https://citrusframework.org/[Citrus] test framework.
Please make sure to install Citrus as a JBang application (see link:../../install-citrus.adoc[Citrus installation guide]).

You can run the test with:

[source,shell]
----
cd test
citrus run petstore-client.camel.it.yaml
----

The test prepares the complete infrastructure and starts the Camel route automatically via JBang.
