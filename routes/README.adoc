== Routes

This example shows how routes are defined in Yaml.

=== Install JBang

First install JBang according to https://www.jbang.dev

When JBang is installed then you should be able to run from a shell:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang --version
----

This will output the version of JBang.

To run this example you can either install Camel on JBang via:

[source,sh]
----
$ jbang app install camel@apache/camel
----

Which allows to run Camel JBang with `camel` as shown below.

=== How to run

You can run this example using:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run *
----

Camel will start a route that periodically provides a greeting message.

=== Live reload

You can run the example in dev mode which allows you to edit the example,
and hot-reload when the file is saved.

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run * --dev
----

=== Run directly from GitHub

The example can also be run directly by referring to the GitHub URL as shown:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run https://github.com/apache/camel-jbang-examples/tree/main/routes
----

=== Developer Web Console

You can enable the developer console via `--console` flag as show:

[source,sh]
----
$ camel run * --console
----

Then you can browse: http://localhost:8080/q/dev to introspect the running Camel Application.
Under "beans" Camel should display bean `greeter`.
